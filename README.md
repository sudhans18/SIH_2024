# AI-Driven Plant Disease Prediction System 🌾

This repository hosts the code and resources for an AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System. Designed to support farmers and agricultural experts, this solution leverages computer vision to detect crop diseases in real-time, helping users make informed decisions to enhance crop health and productivity.


## Project Overview
This system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze crop images and environmental data, accurately identifying crop diseases. The application offers personalized treatment recommendations and actionable insights to help manage disease spread and protect crop yields. It is deployed as a web application to make it accessible to farmers in various regions.
## Features

- **Disease Detection:** Detects and identifies specific crop diseases from images.
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Provides customized recommendations based on disease type.
- **Data Analytics:** Analyzes environmental factors and integrates them into disease prediction.
- **Platform Deployment:** Available on web platform for widespread accessibility.
## Tech Stack
**Programming Language :** Python

**Libraries and Frameworks :** TensorFlow, Keras, Flask/Django (for web deployment)

**Model Architecture :** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
